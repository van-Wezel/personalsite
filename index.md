## Welcome
On the homepage of the personal site for prof. dr. Richard van Wezel. He is active at [Radboud university](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/wezel-r-van/) and [University of Twente](https://people.utwente.nl/r.j.a.vanwezel) as researcher and lecturer.


In the lab of Richard van Wezel we study how activity of groups of neurons results into behaviour. We investigate how visual perception can be explained in terms of electrical activity in networks of communicating neurons. Our goal is to study these processes from the level of single neurons to large brain networks. To cover these levels of neural processing we rely on neurophysiological methods like neural recordings, imaging and behavioural measurements. Findings are translated into clinical applications with a focus on Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and the application of smart glasses.
