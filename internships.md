## Internships

There are several options for both Bachelor- and Master internships at the research group of Richard van Wezel. At Radboud University he is head of the research group of visual neuroscience, at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour. The main research theme is "Action, Perception, and Control".

Also have a look at previous [publications](https://van-wezel.github.io/personalsite/publications.html)


- **Visual prosthetic implants and image preprocessing** *by Jaap de Ruyter van Steveninck*

Visual prostheses may restore some visual perception in blind people by electrically stimulating neurons in V1 with up to thousands of electrodes. Because this (bionic) vision is of relatively low quality (e.g. low resolution) compared to normal vision, it is important to pre-process the visual input from the environment, to only convey task-relevant information and filter out distractions. We evaluate and develop state-of-the-art deep learning solutions to improve performance in daily living tasks such as wayfinding. Behavioral experiments with a virtual reality simulation of prosthetic vision in healthy individuals may provide useful insights on future directions for pre-processing strategies in prosthetic vision. And to test simplified cases, we can even replace human subjects with virtual reality agents, similar to AI’s that are used in games. Due to the combination of computational aspects, the work with human subjects and the practical / technical questions, we can always discuss a project that is tailored to your background and interests.





- **Restoring light sensitivity in the retina with optogenetic approaches** *by Bas van Gorp & Tim Schröder* 

The most frequent cause of inherited blindness in children is leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). While gene therapeutic approaches aim to restore protein expression in affected retinal cells, this approach is less promising in later stages of retinal degeneration, where retinal photoreceptor cells died. A possible solution to restore vision at this late stage is the introduction of light-sensitive ion channels directly in bipolar cells or retinal ganglion cells. This optogenetic approach has been shown to restore visual function in mice to some degree [1], it is unclear how what the effects on cortical visual processing are. In this project, we try to answer that question by directly measuring neural activity in visual cortex of a mouse model of LCA that has been treated with an optogenetic construct to restore light sensitivity in the retina. We use 2-photon imaging [Link1] to measure the population activity of many neurons over weeks and high-density extracellular electrophysiological recordings [Link2] to to measure the fine temporal interactions between groups of neurons while mice perform behavioral tasks in a floating-ball treadmill virtual reality setup [Link3].

- **Detection and eventual prediction of freezing-of-Gait in Parkingson's** *by Laurens Kirkels* 

My current research focuses on detection and eventual prediction of Freezing-of-Gait in people living with Parkinson’s Disease. Making use of wearable sensors, such as insoles, ankle sensors and smartphone, we investigate freezing episodes in an at-home situation ([eHealth House, TU Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/nl/techmed/faciliteiten/htwb-labs/ehealth-house/)). Additionally, I work on analysis of two-photon calcium imaging datasets from visual experiments in awake mice.

- **Neural maps of space in visually impaired persons** *by Loes Ottink*

We know that the brain forms some sort of maps of the environment around us. These cognitive maps support navigation and wayfinding in familiar and unfamiliar environments. But how does this work if visual information is not available, for example in persons with a visual impairment? In this project, we are using MRI-scans to investigate if and how such a map is formed when an environment is presented via touch, in visually impaired and sighted persons.
We are looking for a motivated student to join this project!
In this internship, you will gain experience in:  
    - Behavioural testing of participants  
    - fMRI imaging  
    - Advanced (fMRI) data analysis

- **Understanding brain mechanisms in Parkinson’s disease using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)** *by Helena Cockx*

Parkinson’s disease is a complex brain disorder, typically affecting automatic movements like walking. Understanding the underlying brain mechanisms of this movement disorder is key to develop more advanced treatments. Unfortunately, it is quite hard to investigate gait problems in fMRI scanners in which subjects need to lay still. This research makes therefor use of multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new mobile brain imaging device making use of infrared light to measure brain oxygenation in different cortical areas simultaneously.
During this internship, you will be able to assist and interact with patients with Parkinson’s disease during an fNIRS experiment where we investigate the cortical processes during “freezing of gait”, a sudden, relatively brief episode of inability to produce effective forward stepping, described by patients ‘as if the feet are glued to the floor’. Alongside you will be carrying out your own fNIRS project with healthy participants, investigating the cortical processes of automatic versus non-automatic movements.
